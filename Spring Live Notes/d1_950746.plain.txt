Build tool : Maven
===============

Build Process in java based project/application management:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

develpers duty/responsibility to develop a java based business application:

1. write some source code(bunch of classes, inteface...) 

2.add some external  jarfiles to the classpath (dependencies of our application)
in JDBC dao project, driver jar file is the dependency of our project.

3.compile the code.

4.prepare some test cases. (Unit test, Junit, Mockito, Sonar ) 

5.add Junit/mockito related jar files inside the classpath

6.compile  and run the test cases.

7.arrange our code in a standard folder structure

Java based Webapplication:
----------------------------------

*.java
*.class
*.jar
*.html
*.css
*.js
.*xml files
*.mp3, mp4, jpg, gif 

8.Do the packaging : build the jar, war file. 

9.deploy this jar file/ war file to the server.





--if any mistake identified then developer performs above task again and again.

build process: keeping our project ready for execution/release is called build process.


--manually doing this build process will increase the burden on developer

--to automate this build process of java applicaiton , apache foundation released
a tool called ANT (Another Neet Tool).

the problem with ANT tool is :

1. ANT does not have the capabilities of donwloading the required jar files from internate automatically.

2. It can not prepare,compile and run the test cases automatically.

3.In ANT we need to write a build.xml file which is very lenghty xml file.


As a solution Apache foundation released another build tool called Maven.

--Gradle


--we can develop java application using Maven by 2 ways:

1.using console based (here we need to download the maven s/w and install it in our
local computer ,and then we need to set path and some environment variable to
develop java application)

--after that using some command in command prompt we can generate the template of our java application without any IDE.


2.using IDE: here we don't need to install any kind of extra s/w.
STS has inbuilt support of Maven and Gradle


Maven terminology:
===============

1. artifact :-

--An artifact is an outcome in maven, it can be a file, .class file or a jar file, war file,ear file,etc.

2. archetype:-

--it is project template for creating similar type of project in maven.

3. Groupid:  

--it is an Id used to identify the artifacts of a perticular organization (naming convention is similar to package name.) com.masai



4.artiactid : it is the id for the final outcome (artifactid name will be the root folder of our application)

5.pom.xml :  (project object model) : all the information will be their in this file.

--in this model, entire application itself will be considered as an object.

it defines following properties for a project:

1. Name
2.version

3. packaging (jar, war, ear)

4.dependecnies : required jar files.

5.plugins: will inhance the functionality of our project.

docker 
jenkins (CI/CD)


Maven Repository:
================

-- a repository is a store where maven maintains plugins, archetypes, and lots of jar files used for building different kinds of java projects.

maven repo are of 3 types:

1.central repo :- it is the maven's own repo in which it maintains all kinds of project related plugins, archetypes, jars etc.

https://repo1.maven.org/maven2

2.remote repo : this repo is maintained within the organization for sharing plugins, archetypes and jar files for multiple projects withing orgnizations. ex: masairepo



3.local repo: this repo will be created inside the developer computer.  (.m2) is the name for this repo.
 
mysql-connector.jar :

pom.xml:

.m2 --- 

maven build life cycle:
==================

maven build life cycle contains diff phases:


1. validate: - in this phase it will verify the project diectory structure is valid or not. and it has pom.xml file is there or not.

2.compile: maven compiles all the source code of the project by downloading and adding requied jar files in the classpath.

3.test-compile: if we have written any unit test cases those code will be compiled.

4.test : maven will run all the test cases and it will show how many test cases are success and how many fails.

5.package : maven will bundle our java code into a jar file inside 'target' folder.

6.install : that jar file in step 5 will be stored in the localrepo.

7.deploy : maven stores the application jar file to the central repo.

**8.clean : here maven will delete and remove all the files that are generated in previous build. this phase is an isolated phase.


Note: if we execute any phase to build the maven project then maven will execute all the phases till that given phase.except phase 8.clean.

>mvn clean   :- remove and delete previous build
>mvn test   : till the test phase.
>mvn deploy: 
>mvn validate:

--package.json ---- pom.xml



src/main/java  : -- here we need to place our source code

src/main/resources : any xml file, properties files, text files


src/test/java  : -- here we need to place our source code to unit testing

src/test/resources : any xml file, properties files, text files to unit testing


after creating a maven project we need to change the java  version of the maven project from jdk 5 to jdk 8


search in google: "maven compiler source"

 <properties>
    <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
  </properties>


after pasting the above tag inside the pom.xml file we need to update our maven project:

right click on the project--->maven ---> update maven project.(select force update)


--to build our maven application : --->right click on the project----> Run as--->Maven build... -----> inside Goal type : clean package ----> run
