Q1/- What are the limitations of EntityManager methods to perform CRUD operations with
DB?
Ans. 
1. Cannot search on data which is non-key column/attribute of a table.
2. Cannot fetch multiple rows of a table to-print.
3. Bulk update and deletion of data based on some conditions not possible.
4. To overcome this problem JPA has provided JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language).
